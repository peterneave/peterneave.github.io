## Learning and our ability to memorize

There are a lot of technical people who complete certifications and write about it. I'm also here to write down some notes but not because I want to share ways you can get certified but because I want to deal with the trauma of certification. It was not an easy process for me but hopefully I can help someone who is reading this to embrace the struggle and grow a little.

Lets face it - we are forgetful creatures. We learn better by doing then by just memorising facts. It is not easy to memorise a complex system that has been built up over decades and is still evolving. When it comes to remembering details in general - I would prefer to just read up on it before I needed it. For me, it's easier to remember _where_ I wrote down a page of information than it is to remember the whole page of information - kind of like a computer pointer pointing to a heap address.

If we plan for the fact that we will forget then the only way to keep knowledge forefront in our minds is to continue to go back and re-learn what we have forgotten. There is a rate of which information decays from our minds. To keep it relent, we need to [increase our rate of learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve#increasing_rate_of_learning). At the moment, you need to recertify your AWS certifications every three years but it's probably best to keep on top of it more often or risk higher amount of re-learning.

## Use the services

You need experience. Learning facts and figures is sometime necessary but the school of experience is necessary for an AWS Certification. There are [Workshops](https://workshops.aws) or immersion days you can attend. However, it isn't the same as if you have an idea and you want to try it out yourself. Be creative with your craft and have fun in the sandbox of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free). Just don't forget to set your budget alerts first.

## Question First Approach

One study suggests that we should not just focus on absorbing information but that we learn by retrieving information as well. In the study about [retrieval practice](https://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2011/2011_Karpicke_Blunt_Science.pdf) it discusses how testing yourself before your exam, such as doing practice questions, can be more effective than revisiting your notes. It forces your brain to recall and use the information actively rather than just reviewing it passively.

In practise, you might take the official practise questions on [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws) to gauge what you know and what you don't know. For me at least, the shock of 'what the heck is that?' triggers a stress response that I appease once I finally learn about the subject in the course. I've seen countless times throughout my time studying that some insignificant dot point on a slide ends up being a question in the exam.

Here is the process:

1. Answer the questions.
2. Learn the answers.
3. Do number 1 until your are confident.
4. Take the exam.

## Where to learn

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek) with Stephane Maarek - he covers the exam and supplies a large set of practise questions also.
- [Learn Cantrill](https://learn.cantrill.io) with Adrian Cantrill. He goes a beyond the basics and teaches you more than you need to learn - which is a good thing. Some practise questions are supplied too.
- [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws) - contains the official set of practise questions and these are **necessary** to do before your exam as you will find some of these questions in the exam itself.

## Before you do the exam

Check the exam guide with a fine tooth comb. Physically check off the technologies and services and make sure you are aware of what they are. Make sure that you are familiar with all the [AWS Products](/posts/aws_products) at a basic level.

Become familiar testing application and the [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.pearsonvue.com/content/dam/VUE/vue/en/documents/clients/cpshr/Testing-Screen-What-to-Know.pdf) on Pearson OnVue. Download the OnVue software and run it on your machine. It doesn't work for my work-supplied machine, it thinks that I am running on a virtual machine and I needed to use a non-work computer to run the exam.

Don't waste time navigating with the mouse. Use the keyboard shortcuts to move between questions. I actually programmed my keyboard to make these a one-button push and it made navigating through the exam much quicker and less stressful.

- `ALT` + `N` for Next
- `ALT` + `P` for Previous
- `ALT` + `F` for Flag
- `CTRL` + `+/-` To enlarge or reduce the screen size.

If you are a non-English speaker then request the 30 minutes extension to the exam before you schedule it.

### During the Exam

You don't have forever, answer the question in about 1-2 minutes. If you don't know or you are uncertain then flag the question and come back to it in the review phase.

## How to answer questions

If you aren't sure then the process of elimination can help you.

1. How many answers are there? Pick three, pick two or one.
2. Two are probably obviously wrong and are just distractors
3. Which out of the remaining two are the correct one? One might be slightly more appropriate than the other.
4. Mark the question for review and come back to it. Sometimes an other question supplies you with information that clarifies the questions or helps you recall information. The exam is a high stress situation and will second guess yourself sometimes.

## Good luck

> A pass is a pass

Don't beat yourself if you don't pass or if you just barely pass. The exams cover a broad range of subjects and you aren't expected to be an expert in everything. Try to remember the questions you weren't sure on and study up on them afterwards. Use the exam itself as a learning tool. If you fail then you need to take a break and learn from your mistakes. Keep studying and don't give up.
