Most of my working career I have been working for 'Microsoft Shops' - focusing on .NET and on C#. Throughout university, I had experience with low-level languages like C++ but the idea of memory allocation and deallocation felt beyond me. Using a garbage-collected language like C# has spoilt me a little.

I started to hear about Rust and how it solved memory management with lifetimes. As it became more popular among developers and it featured more in developer news, I became interested in learning it. I found a few resources and tried many of them. I created a presentation that I could give at work for others to start their journey learning Rust.

It's an enjoyable language to learn, probably because I don't have to work in it professionally. There is something about learning a new language and improving your craft. If you aren't sure where to start - review the slides and get started. It has a steep learning curve.
