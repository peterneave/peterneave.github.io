Keeping record is important. This is my blog. Originally blogs were created by people who wanted to create a `web log` _(a.k.a. blog)_. It's a way to share your knowledge and also keep a track of useful information that you might want to reference in the future. I compare it to the Pensieve in the Harry Potter books.

Hopefully you also find something useful here too.
